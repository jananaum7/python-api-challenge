# python-api-challenge

So in my vacationpyhvplots folder I have three images, two of the screenshots are for my final map, I uploaded two because my previous one did not show the entire image, with the cities on the side. 

Throughout the entirety of my codes, for both   WeatherPy and VacationPy, I had help from both the tutors, expert learning/ chatgpt and my classmates as well.
